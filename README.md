## Project Overview

Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company, has provided data on bike rides taken by its customers. The goal of this project is to analyze the data, gain insights into customer behavior, and provide actionable recommendations to improve Cyclistic's bike-sharing service.

## Phase 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation

In this phase, the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Key steps included:
- Calculating ride durations based on start and end times.
- Filtering out excessively long or short rides.
- Ensuring data accuracy and reliability.

## Phase 2: Data Analysis

During this phase, the data was analyzed to gain a better understanding of customer behavior. Analysis included:
- Summary statistics for ride length.
- Breakdown of customer types (annual members vs. casual riders).
- Total rides and ride durations by customer type.
- Ride length patterns by day of the week and month.
- Differences in ride behavior between customer types.

## Phase 3: Data Visualization

Visualizations were created to present key insights:
- Total rides per day of the week for each customer type.
- Usage patterns by time of day.
- Monthly trends in bike usage.
- Average ride lengths by week days and months.
- Bike type preferences among customers.

## Phase 4: Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:
- Annual members predominantly utilize the bike-sharing service for daily commutes, in contrast to casual riders who prefer leisurely rides, especially on weekends and during the summer months.
  
- Annual members demonstrate a more steady and consistent utilization of the service throughout both the week and the entire year when compared to the more variable patterns observed among casual riders.

- Classic bikes are the preferred choice for both annual members and casual riders. However, annual members predominantly opt for classic bikes and seldom use docked bikes, while casual riders exhibit a greater likelihood of using all available bike types.

- Casual riders generally enjoy longer ride durations, averaging approximately 50% more than those of annual members.

- There is a noticeable decrease in the usage of the bike-sharing service by casual riders during weekends and months compared to the more consistent usage patterns observed among annual members during similar periods.

## Conclusion

This data analysis project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences for Cyclistic's bike-sharing service. The recommendations aim to optimize the service and enhance the customer experience.
